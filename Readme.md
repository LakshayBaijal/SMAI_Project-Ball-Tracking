## 📁 Dataset and Preprocessing

- **Dataset**: TTNet dataset, which provides JSON-based annotations for table tennis ball positions in each frame.
- **Focus**: Only the **ball** is detected (no table or player detection).
- **Conversion**:
  - A custom Python script (`convert_ball_to_yolo.py`) was written to convert JSON annotations into YOLO format: `.txt` files with class ID and normalized coordinates.
  - Directory structure:
    ```
    yolo_dataset/
    ├── images/
    │   ├── train/
    │   └── val/
    └── labels/
        ├── train/
        └── val/
    ```

## ⚙️ Model Training

- **Model Used**: `yolov8n.pt` (Nano version for faster training).
- **Training Command**:
  ```bash
  yolo train model=yolov8n.pt data=ttnet_ball.yaml epochs=20 imgsz=640 batch=16 project=TTBallProject name=ball_yolo_model
  ```

## 🔍 Inference
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  yolo predict model=TTBallProject/ball_yolo_model/weights/best.pt source=videos/TT1.mp4 conf=0.25 save=True
  ```

- This generates an annotated output video with bounding boxes around detected balls.

## 📈 Post-Processing: Speed & Direction
- A script (post_process_speed_angle.py) was implemented to:

- Read YOLO predictions from .txt files.

- Calculate speed using Euclidean distance between detected centers in consecutive frames.

- Compute direction using arctangent (atan2) function.

- Annotate video with speed (px/frame) and angle (degrees).

- Distance: d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
- Speed: speed = d / time_between_frames
- Direction - angle = atan2(y2 - y1, x2 - x1) × (180 / π)
- Final Output: Annotated video with bounding boxes, speed, and direction arrow.

## 📌 Notes

- Trained entirely locally due to GPU session limits in Kaggle.

- Focused only on ball tracking.

- Could be extended to detect bounce events, estimate speed in m/s, or predict ball trajectory.
